## Functionality

**Make the scene ready!**
- [ ] Create a ground (Earth in the screenshot) and position to the bottom
- [ ] On loading the user sees a homepage/start screen which gives the directions for navigating and an introduction to the adventure.
- [ ] Create the spaceship and add it above the ground
- [ ] Create the Mars planet position to the top right

**Make it alive!**

- [ ] Make the spaceship clickable when the player clicks on it
- [ ] Open a modal window that asks the user for the password
- [ ] A lunch button to lunch the spaceship

(If the player enters the correct password lunch the missile, otherwise display an alert with   this message "Alert! security breach!")

**Lift off!**

- [ ] Use the CSS 3 animation to move the spaceship to the moon.

*Tip:* for better UX try to add some transition and add use the `setinterval` function to make animations run smoothly.
